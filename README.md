# YouTube Download Music (download music with YOUTUBE)
This is the first version of my program.  The bot receives the ID of the video clip, then finds it and downloads it in MP4 format. Next, convert the video to MP3 format  Please get an API token from Google Developers to work with the bot. Details on how to get it can be found in the README.

Instructions on how to get an API key:

1. Go to the site "https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard" and create a new project
2. Go to "Library"
3. We are looking for "YouTube Data API" in the search and select the latest version (see the screenshot)
